                        and her friends started experiencing some strange phone calls.
                        They later learned the calls were coming from a crazed serial killer,

                        His phone calls usually consist of many questions, the main one being:
                        Whats your favorite scary movie? Along with many scary movie trivia,
                        ending with bloody pieces of innocent lives scattered around the small town of Woodsboro.
